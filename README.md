### Authors: Nurjahan Sultana, Wenqi Lu, Xinqi Fan, Moi Hoon Yap

This work addresses a critical issue in medical AI: models trained on dermoscopic images often fail when tested on real-world clinical images due to domain shift.

ðŸ’¡ What We Did

We introduced IMPS, a diverse clinical dataset built from SD198, ISIC-Clinical, MED-NODE, and PAD-UFES-20.

We benchmarked supervised (ATDOC, LIC) and unsupervised (DANN, ADDA) domain adaptation methods.

We showed that DANN, an unsupervised method, generalises better than othersâ€”even without using target labels.

Our findings emphasise that evaluation on narrow datasets can mislead model performance claims.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation

We designed a two-fold evaluation to test real-world generalisation:

Single-target evaluation: Each clinical dataset (SD198, ISIC-Clinical, MED-NODE, PAD-UFES) was tested independently.

Diverse-target evaluation: We combined them into the IMPS dataset to simulate real-world variability (e.g. device, lighting, skin tone).

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

IMPS is a diverse clinical dataset created by combining:

SD198

ISIC (clinical)

MED-NODE

PAD-UFES-20

It reflects real-world variability in demographics, lighting, devices, and image qualityâ€”making it suitable for robust domain adaptation evaluation.

ðŸ—‚ IMPS image IDs will be published soon.
